# The importance of Numpy, Pandas and Matplotlib libraries in Python

<p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp In this blog, I'm going to tell you generally about Numpy, Pandas and Matplotlib libraries which are the most important libraries for some fields. For their usage fields, these libraries are generally used in the fields of Image Processing, Data Science and Data Visualization. For instance, To develop a project in Artifical Intelligence, We have to train a model with data will be used for training, validation and testing. These topics want so many effort to achieve. Even though it can be thought all of them are too hard to do, It's pretty easy with these libraries in Python.

<p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp First of all, the matter point is why we use numpyarray instead of using lists in Python. Although there is a data structure named list in Python to create dimensional matrices, there are important points to use Numpy that makes the similar work. For example, Due to lists are quite slow for Data science, one of the best features of Numpy Array is that it's finely 50x faster than lists in Python. As well the supporting functions in itself, creating some specific standart process can just be done with a line. Therefore, Numpy library is frequently used in data science where the speed and resources are important.

<p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp For Pandas library, when it comes to examine such as what does my data have?, all data are integer or string? how many entries do I have? Can I just work with the data in the specific range? Directly Pandas library should come in our mind. Pandas library in Python makes a person think data like a table that is actually an object of dictionary data type in Python. So we can look at the number of columns and including rows that mean entries. Moreover, The data type in each column can be seperately reached out. I think the most important is that we can investigate the data with some filters or range. For example, The data with entries that has only bigger than value 5 or another specified value can easily be examined.

<p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp We may not sometimes aware what is the meaning of my data? What does my data have a relation in itself? How does it acts for some limit? Therefore, if we can't just think the data in text format or if we only want to visualize it, we can directly use a visualizator that is matplotlib in Python. It makes a person think with visual appearence. Therefore, matplotlib is used for seeing the direction, acts, limitations of the data so on. </p> 

<p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp As a result, the people who wants to work with data as well examining it, should use the libraries that are Numpy, Pandas and Matplotlib for their projects. Thus, They will be able to deal with big data in matrices using Numpy, examine their data with using Pandas which makes it like a table and visualize their data to make it more understandable. These are why they are used by Data Scientist, Data Analyst or Data Engineer so on.</p>
