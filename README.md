This text is a blog about Why numpy, pandas and matplotlib libraries in Python are so important for Patika.Dev Website.

# YOLO(You Look Only Once) Model

<p> In this blog, I'm going to tell you generally about Numpy, Pandas and Matplotlib libraries which are the most important libraries for some fields. Especially, they are generally used in the fields of Image Processing, Data Science and Data Visualization in a row. For instance, To develop a project for Artifical Intelligence, We have to train a model with data will be used for training, validation and testing. Even though it can be thought all of them are too hard to do, It's pretty easy with these libraries in Python.

<p> First of all, the matter point is why we use numpyarray instead of using lists in Python. Although there is a data structure named list in Python to create dimensional matrices, there are important points to use Numpy that makes the similar work. For example, Due to lists are quite slow for Data science, one of the features of Numpy Array is that it's finely 50x faster than lists in Python. As well the supporting functions in itself, creating some specific standart process can just be done with a line. Therefore that's way frequently used in data science where the speed and resources are important.

<p> For Pandas library, when it comes to examine data such as what does my data have?, all data are integer or string? how many entries do I have? Can I just work with the data in the specific range? Pandas library in Python makes a person think data like a table that is actually an object of dictionary data type in Python. So we can look at the number of columns and rows that mean entries. Moreover, The data type in each column can be seperately reached out.
